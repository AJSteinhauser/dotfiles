# Configurations

This is my personal configuration for tools like .zsh, .git, nvim, tmux ect... 
Often times these configurations get messy over time by the nature of needing to fix/get something working quickly and not bothering with best practices. 
To combat this, every ~6 months --> 1 year I will do a complete rebuild of all nvim configs (where the most amount of changes are made) and evaluate which plugins are worth adding and removing.
These ```Clean``` version will be given a tagged release.
